            <h3>step 3</h3>
                <p>In the dropdown window, select your repositories.</p>

            <h3>step 5</h3>
                <p>Give your repository a name in the “repository name” box near the top.</p>
                <p class="note">Note that at this point you can add a README.md by checking the “Add a README file” or you can opt not to do so and add it later but a README.md will be required for the repository to work correctly.</p>
            <h3>step 6</h3>

                <P class="option">README.md : if not created at time of repository creation</P>
                <P class="option">index.html </P>
                <P class="option">style.css (optional: used to help with site formatting)</P>
                <P class="subnote">style.css in the index.html file make sure that you include a link to the style.css file in the <head> element using the following format:</P>
                <P class="subsubnote"> between pointy brackets include: link rel = "stylesheet" href = "style.css" </P>
                <P class="subsubnote"> This will allow you to easily make a lot of changes to the entire html document.</P>
                <P class="subsubnote"> This file must have the .css extension and not contain and html code.</P>
                <P class="option">logic.js (optional)</P>
            <h3>step 8</h3>
